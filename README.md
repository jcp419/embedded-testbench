Code for the AS5048B Magnetic Rotary Encoder and TSSOP-14 Breakout Board
======================================================================================
### About
This is the code for running the AS5048B magnetic rotary encoder and the TSSOP-14 breakout board. It will output the angle position of the 14-bit angular position sensor as a number between 0 and 360.  

### Usage
Required electrical components: \
1 AS5048B magnetic rotary encoder \
1 TSSOP-14 breakoutboard \
1 beaglebone green/back board 

Connect to ground, SDA, and SCL on beaglebone. Connect power to 3V on beaglebone.  

### Notes
This code has been tested with python 3.6 on a beaglebone black.
