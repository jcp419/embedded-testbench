Hi! [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-Color-Sensor-Filter-White/dp/B00OKCRU5M/ref=pd_day0_328_1/132-2855001-6144927?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00OKCRU5M&pd_rd_r=d7b78cb5-650f-46fd-8ce9-5b5f22d6acb6&pd_rd_w=PlU1j&pd_rd_wg=LK5rj&pf_rd_p=bf16faa6-f0a7-4c6d-bf3d-c41c014c7d2f&pf_rd_r=5F9WX81HNM86JZTRRA1S&psc=1&refRID=5F9WX81HNM86JZTRRA1S) is a link to an rgb sensor ISH is thinking of using for the science boxes: 
plz write code to get this to work on a beaglebone. 

A good place to start would be googling and pulling up the datasheet for the sensor.
